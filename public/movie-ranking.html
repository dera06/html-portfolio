        <br>
        <p><em>Intersteller</em> is a Sci-Fi based movie and the reason why it is on the top of my list is due to how the movie is layed and <br> brought out; the music, scenery, and everything about the movie just gives me this sense of wanting to leave earth and <br> explore space.</p></li>
        <br>
        <li><h2><strong>One Piece</strong></h2><img src="../assets/images/one piece.png" alt="One Piece" height="450">
        <p><em>One Piece</em> isn't really considered a movie but I decided to put it up cause why not. I just Love <em>One Piece</em>; the story line, <br> character development, characters, sceneries, and quality evolution is the best and the things a mostly love about not only animes <br> but this one in particular.</p></li>
        <li><h2><strong>The Martian</strong></h2><img src="../assets/images/the martian.png" alt="The Martian" height="430">
