        <p>I am new to coding and just starting out with front-end development and currently making my way up and learning as I go. <br> I am currently taking a course on Udemy titled "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" and of course, starting out with 'HTML' <br> as though this is my first project using 'HTML' only. I am an enthusiastic person, keen, outgoing, and an open-minded person <br> and would like to explore and new areas that help me further expand my knowledge and perspective on things.</p></td>
